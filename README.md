## Abstract 
Despite the transition to digital information exchange, many documents, such as invoices, taxes, memos and questionnaires, historical data, and answers to exam questions, still require handwritten inputs. In this regard, there is a need to implement Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) - this is an automatic way to decrypt records using a computer. Handwriting recognition is challenging because of the virtually infinite number of ways a person can write the same message. For this proposal we introduce Kazakh handwritten text recognition research, a comprehensive dataset of Kazakh handwritten texts is necessary. This is particularly true given the lack of a dataset for handwritten Kazakh text. In this paper,  we provide our extensive Kazakh offline Handwritten Text dataset (KOHTD), which has 3000 handwritten exam papers. The sources of all the exam papers in the datasets were written by students. The database consists of more than 140335 images and there are approximately 922010 symbols. It can serve researchers in the field of handwriting recognition tasks by using deep and machine learning.We used a variety of popular text recognition methods for word and line recognition in our studies, including CTC-based and attention-based methods. The findings demonstrate KOHTD's diversity.
